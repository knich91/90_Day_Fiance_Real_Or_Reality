# 90_Day_Fiance_Real_Or_Reality
1. This project aims to explore the dynamics and success rates of relationships featured in TLC's 90 Day Fiancé and its spin-offs to shed light on the societal stigma surrounding marriages between US citizens and foreign spouses. By analyzing factors such as age differences, how couples met, and the time they knew each other before getting engaged, my project seeks to provide a data-driven perspective on these relationships. To ground the findings in real-world context, I will also compare the show's trends to broader societal data, including US marriage/divorce rates and K1 fiancé visa applications. This project leverages real societal trends to challenge stereotypes, highlight the complexities of international relationships, and foster a more nuanced understanding of this cultural phenomenon.
