# 90_Day_Fiance_Real_Or_Reality
1. This project aims to explore the dynamics and success rates of relationships featured in TLC's 90 Day Fiancé to shed light on the societal stigma surrounding marriages between US citizens and foreign spouses. By analyzing factors such as age, gender of the US citizens, how couples met, and the shown support from friends and family during the season, my project seeks to provide a data-driven perspective on these relationships. To ground the findings in real-world context, I will also compare the show's trends to broader societal data, including US marriage/divorce rates and K1 fiancé visa applications. This project leverages real societal trends to challenge stereotypes, highlight the complexities of international relationships, and foster a more nuanced understanding of this cultural phenomenon.
2. 90 Day Fiance data compliled by watching and help of ChatGPT. Marriage and Divorce data found through the US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/table?q=marriage%20and%20divorce%20in%20kentucky&t=Families%20and%20Living%20Arrangements&g=010XX00US_040XX00US01,04,05,06,09,12,13,16,17,18,20,22,23,24,29,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,40,41,42,45,46,47,48,49,51,53,55&y=2023) and K1 Non-Immigrant Petition Data by the US State Department (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics/monthly-nonimmigrant-visa-issuances.html)
